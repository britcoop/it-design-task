                  I&nbsp;accomplished my goals of trying to create the strategic pillars 
                  and having a structure that would live on for years to come, as well as 
                  getting into the weeds on the things we want to get very specific on 
                  for the next three years. With Info-Techâ€™s help, we accomplished both.

                    The documentation that supports the program was shared with us 
                    during and after the session in the form of heat maps, business 
                    capabilities models, and architecture diagrams. These documents were
                    practical and effective in our discussions with stakeholders.</p>

                We started seeing results from the Agile workshop almost immediately. 
                This was apparent through more team collaboration, IT and product 
                engagement, and more measurable business value through enhancements 
                delivered to production for our customers in shorter development 
                cycles.</p>
